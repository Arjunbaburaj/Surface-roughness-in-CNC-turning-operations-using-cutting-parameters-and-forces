## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on **predicting surface roughness (Ra)** in CNC turning operations using **Machine Learning**.  
Surface roughness directly affects the **quality, durability, and performance** of machined components.  
By building an interpretable predictive model, this work aims to optimize machining parameters,  
reduce inspection time, and enable **data-driven process control** in manufacturing.
